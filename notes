<!-- req.body:

Think of it like a bag that carries information from the user to the server.
When you submit a form on a website (like entering a username and password), the entered data is put into this bag (req.body).
In your code, you use req.body to get the username and role that the user entered in the login form.
req.user:

After you submit your form, the server checks if your username and password are correct (authentication).
If they are correct, the server puts information about you into another bag (req.user).
This bag (req.user) contains details about the user who just logged in, like their username and role.
In your code, you use req.user to get the authenticated user's information, specifically the role.
In your login route, you're doing the following:

You check req.user to see who the user is (like a doctor or an admin) after they've successfully logged in.
You also check req.body to see what the user entered in the login form.
So, in simpler terms:

req.body is like looking at what the user just typed or submitted.
req.user is like looking at who the user is after they've successfully logged in. -->
